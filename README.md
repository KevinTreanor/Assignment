Kevin Treanor C15337401 OOP Assignment

This assignment is my version of the Heads Up Display(HUD) from the poplular Halo Series. The program starts off with a blank screen with the UNSC Logo. Using the opacity function I mage the text "Loading..." appear. There is also a start up sound included.

Then we are brought to the main screen of the project, the HUD. There is a PSHAPE Shield bar and the sides of the HUD make it look like it's 1st person. A line comes down the screen accompanied with the text "Scanning.." in the top right corner. This scanner locates points of interest on the background Image. When these points of interest are clicked, they are zoomed in on and a paragraph appears besdie them explaing what they are and how they are relevant. When the scanning is complete the text in the top right changes. There is a working radar in the bottom left corner. I used a three tier ellipse to draw the background, a triangle for the user and rotational lines to circle it. In the bottom right there is a power bar also made from the PSHAPE function. It's value decreases when the over shield is active. To use the overshield press any key. When the key is pressed a transparent layer will come over the HUD and appropriate sound FX will play. If the power runs out the user is taken to a shutdown screen where shut down sounds are played and the user has the choice to click the recharge text to be taken to another screen.

The points I am most proud of in this assignment are:
-The aesthetic HUD
-The Zoom function from the scanner
-The radar
-The Overshield
-The multiple sound FX
